<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 32 years old and trying to learn how to code and hopefully maybe someday 
  to start working as a Programmer or Web Developer. I finished university studying history,
  a subject which I really care about and got a Bachelor and Master degree from 
  the Faculty of History and Philology, part of the University of Tirana. I wrote my 
  dissertation thesis: "The Political and Religious Activity of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem" in 2 years
  and was highly appreciated by my professors but living in a small country like Albania, you can't achieve
  and can't afford a career in that direction. So I tried to change the direction of my professional activities 
  and worked for more than 5 years in the logistic services but without any professional satisfaction I decided 
  to quit my job and start a new interesting experience which to begin with, is satisfying my thirsty for knowledge.</p>
